# Cryptocurrencies


## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and thereby create a report including the traded cryptocurrencies classified by group according to their characteristics.
This classification report could be used by any investment bank to propose a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients.

We used the following methods for the analysis:

* Preprocessing the database,
* Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis,
* Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means,
* Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
